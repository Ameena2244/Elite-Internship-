Updated Task 3 with proper file


# ✨ Task 3: Instagram Sparkle Effect on Likes

As part of the Elite Internship, I redesigned a core Instagram interaction by adding a **sparkle animation** when the like button is clicked.

## 🔹 Highlights:
- Sparkle animation when the ❤️ is tapped
- Adds a fun and interactive user experience
- Simple HTML + CSS + JS used
- Engaging effect to increase user interaction

This redesign shows how simple visual feedback improves the emotional connection users have with the platform.
