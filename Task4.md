 I developed an interactive Augmented Reality (AR) train model that runs directly in the browser using WebAR technology. This project demonstrates how 3D models can be viewed in real-world environments using just a smartphone camera — without needing any app installation.

🔍 Highlights:
🚄 Created a realistic 3D train model

📱 Works on smartphones with camera access — no app required

🧠 Demonstrates immersive learning and visualization through AR

💡 Suitable for education, demo presentations, or virtual tours
